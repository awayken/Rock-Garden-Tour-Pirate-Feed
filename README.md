Rock Garden Tour (Pirate Feed)
==============================

Generates a pirate RSS feed for the [Rock Garden Tour radio show](http://www.sdpb.org/rockgardentour/), using CFML.

Visit [the url](http://rockgardentour.awayken.com) to view the current episodes and to subscribe to the RSS feed.

This project is a combination of a bunch of new things for me:

* CloudBees
* Open Bluedragon CFML
* git
* GitHub

I **highly doubt** this project will be of use to anyone else, but sometimes that happens in Open Source.
