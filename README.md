# Rock Garden Tour (Pirate Feed) #

Generates a pirate RSS feed for the [Rock Garden Tour radio show](http://www.sdpb.org/rockgardentour/), using ColdFusion ([Open Bluedragon on Google AppEngine](http://wiki.openbluedragon.org/wiki/index.php/Category:GoogleAppEngine)).

This project is a combination of a bunch of new things for me:

* Google AppEngine
* Open Bluedragon CFML
* git
* GitHub

I **highly doubt** this project will be of use to anyone else, but sometimes that happens in Open Source.
